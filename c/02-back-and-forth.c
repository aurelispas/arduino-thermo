/*
 * Assignment #2: Create a star that moves back and forth on the screen.
 *
 * See the example ruby program. Run with:
 *
 *   ruby 02-back-and-forth.rb
 *
 * Hints:
 *
 * - To create a pause in your loop, consider using usleep. See:
 *
 *     man 3 usleep
 *
 * - You may need to "flush" the output buffer (stdout) in order to see
 *   changes occurring in real time. See:
 *
 *     man 3 fflush
 *
 * - The Control-M character (0x08) moves the cursor to the beginning of the
 *   line.
 *
 * Comple & run with:
 *
 *   gcc 02-back-and-forth.c -o 02-back-and-forth && ./02-back-and-forth
